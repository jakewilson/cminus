- [x] variables must be declared before use
- [x] multiple variables of the same name cannot be declared in the same scope
- [x] each program must have one main function
- [x] evaluate expression types
- [x] variables can only be assigned to expressions of the same type
- [x] create new symbol table upon each '{'
- [x] destroy current symbol table upon each '}'
- [x] check previous symbol tables if current id is not found in current scope
- [x] array indices must be integers
- [ ] arrays must always have brackets after their use
