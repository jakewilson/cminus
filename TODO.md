To do for semantics (not complete):
- [x] no void variables
- [ ] return statements must match function return types
- [ ] function calls must match function definitions in type and # of args
- [ ] add symbol table
- [x] variables must be declared before use
- [ ] multiple variables of the same name cannot be declared in the same scope
- [x] each program must have one main function
